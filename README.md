Forever
=======

Forever is a simple web frontend for Amazon Glacier, geared towards photo archival.

It's based on CodeIgniter, Mongo, AWS Glacier, Twitter Bootstrap, and a number of other tools.

Installation
============

For any easy installation, I recommend a Debian + Apache setup.

sudo apt-get install mongo
cd ~
clone git@github.com:alexose/forever.git
